Bhima_ARS_daily shows the data for post-2013 daily river level and discharge we received shortly after the trip in 2018 summer. 

Then, from comparing the dataset to the total list of RDS stations we also received from them, 
we noticed that the dataset was missing data for 2 stations (Kalyaninagar and Khamgaon).

So, we requested the missing data, also at daily timestep, but they shared the data for 15-minute time step for those 2 stations.
